# JWT Authentication Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented JWT-based authentication system for the AI news summarizer application with user registration, login, and points tracking functionality.

## Backend Implementation

### Authentication Components

- **JWT Configuration**: Using `python-jose` and `passlib` for secure authentication
- **MongoDB User Management**: User data stored in MongoDB with schema:
  ```json
  {
    "user_id": "unique_object_id",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "hashed_password": "bcrypt_hashed_password",
    "points": 0,
    "summaries_read": [],
    "daily_read_log": { "2025-07-09": 3, "2025-07-08": 1 },
    "created_at": "timestamp",
    "updated_at": "timestamp"
  }
  ```

### API Endpoints Added

1. **POST /api/auth/register** - User registration
2. **POST /api/auth/login** - User login (returns JWT token)
3. **GET /api/auth/me** - Get current user info (requires authentication)
4. **POST /api/summaries/{summary_id}/read** - Mark summary as read (earns 1 point)

### MongoDB Functions Added

- `create_user()` - Creates new user in database
- `get_user_by_email()` - Retrieves user by email
- `get_user_by_id()` - Retrieves user by user_id
- `update_user_read_log()` - Updates reading stats and awards points
- `get_user_stats()` - Returns user statistics

### Security Features

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token expiration (30 minutes)
- Protected routes with authentication middleware
- User validation and error handling

## Frontend Implementation

### Authentication Context

- **AuthContext.jsx** - React context for global auth state management
- Handles login, register, logout, and user state
- Automatically fetches user data on token presence
- Includes `markSummaryRead()` function for point tracking

### UI Components

- **AuthPage.jsx** - Modern login/register form with validation
- **Layout.jsx** - Updated navigation with user profile dropdown
- **NewsCard.jsx** - Added "Mark as Read" button for authenticated users

### Features

- Persistent login with localStorage token storage
- Automatic token validation and refresh
- User profile display in navigation (points, email, reading stats)
- Point tracking with visual feedback
- Responsive design with modern UI

## User Experience Features

### Points System

- Users earn 1 point per summary read
- Daily reading tracking in Central Time
- Visual feedback when points are earned
- User stats displayed in navigation dropdown

### Reading Tracking

- Track which summaries user has read
- Daily reading logs by date
- Total reading statistics
- Prevent duplicate point awards for same summary

### Navigation Integration

- Sign In button for unauthenticated users
- User avatar with points display for authenticated users
- Dropdown menu with user stats and logout option
- Seamless authentication flow

## Testing Results

### Backend API Tests

âœ… **Registration**: `POST /api/auth/register` - User creation working
âœ… **Login**: `POST /api/auth/login` - JWT token generation working  
âœ… **User Info**: `GET /api/auth/me` - Protected route with user stats
âœ… **Health Check**: Server running on port 8000

### Frontend Tests

âœ… **Auth Page**: Login/register form loading correctly
âœ… **Navigation**: User profile dropdown and authentication state
âœ… **Summaries Page**: Integration with reading tracking system
âœ… **Development Server**: Running on port 5179

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are properly hashed with bcrypt
- JWT tokens have reasonable expiration time
- Protected routes validate authentication
- User input validation on both frontend and backend
- CORS configuration for API access

## Database Structure

- Users stored in MongoDB `users` collection
- Summaries maintain existing structure with `_id` field for tracking
- Efficient indexing on email field for user lookups
- Timezone-aware datetime handling for reading logs

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Password reset functionality
2. Email verification for new accounts
3. User preferences and customization
4. Reading streaks and achievements
5. Social features (sharing, discussions)
6. Admin dashboard for user management

## Files Modified/Created
